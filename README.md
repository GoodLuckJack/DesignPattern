### DesignPattern

Project for testing design patterns. Right in the project you can see the code implementations.

Each package is one kind of design pattern. You can try to get some idea from the project.

Any suggestions is appreciated!

####1 mediator design pattern

####2 Strategy Design Pattern

The Strategy Pattern difines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

####3 Observer Design Pattern 

The Observer Patern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes
state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
